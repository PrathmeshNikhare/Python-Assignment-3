# Python-Assignment-3
This repository contains assignment 3 from the TuteDude's python course.

# Task-1
>> We define a recursive function fact() with the base case as if the number passed is 1 or 0 then it returns 1 (i.e 1! = 0! = 1).
>> Then we take an integer input from the user using input() function.
>> We pass this integer to our recursive function and get our required output by displaying it through print() function.

# Task-2
>> We first import the module math in our program so we can use its functions and methods.
>> Then we take a number input from user through input() function.
>> In the last step we print the required outputs by using functions from math module and print() function.
>> math.sqrt() for square root, math.log() for logarithm and math.sin() for sine values of the number.
